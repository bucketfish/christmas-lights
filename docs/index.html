        <p>so. a platformer! it's a bit more adventure than platformer, but it's a platformer all the same.</p>
        <p>inspired by many games such as treize, hollow knight, celeste, the other uncompleted metroidvania, night in the woods, and a gmtk theme, this is estimated to be released hopefully by the end of 2022. it's not supposed to be That long of a project,,,</p>

        <h2>[v0.0.0] first small demo! ‚Ä¢ 19.7.2021</h2>
        <p>a month into development. we have some small things :)</p>
        <p>download here for <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/866537631407800361/866547452680470539/christmas_lights_mac.zip" target="_blank">mac</a> and <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/866537631407800361/866538319809347594/christmaslights_win.zip" target="_blank">windows</a></p>
        <p>features/idk instructions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>controls: pretty much the same as hollow knight, aka left/right to move, z to jump, up arrow to pick up, escape to quit (should be all explained in the game hopefully it's clear)</li>
          <li>tab to open notebook, and then up/down left/right to navigate. there are currently only two pages and the bottom tab is blank</li>
          <li>move around and pick up berries (yea that's what the small red things are)</li>
          <li>two rooms and water</li>
          <li>the piece of paper you pick up adds to the notebook</li>
        </ul>

        <p>things that don't work yet:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>options screen</li>
          <li>the third room is empty, and there's only two completed rooms</li>
          <li>currently no way to spend/use the berries</li>
        </ul>

        <p>look out for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>ease of control? do they feel good</li>
          <li>soon i'll add like when you pick up something it tells you what it is i guess</li>
          <li>any glitches/bugs?</li>
          <li>what do you find cool and like? what's annoying/terrible?</li>
        </ul>
